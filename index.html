             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p> I went to Fayetteville High School. After finishing school, I went into the local 392 for HVAC. HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condition. Mostly what I did there was installing AC units or fix them. After 3 years of doing that, I found about programming and fell in love with it. So, I decided to go all the away with it and do a bootcamp. I chose Thinkful because they were helpful, great reviews and had a flex program.
